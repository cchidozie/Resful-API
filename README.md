<h2>Restful API built with Express Js, MongoDB and mongoose</h2>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A model for uploading post to a blog using CRUD operations</p>

<h4>Lessons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>MongoDB is really cool. I love the unburdening of NRDMS</li>
  <li>The Express syntax is also very succint and short</li>
</ul>


<h4>Improvements</h4>
<p>I should build a front end for the project to visualise the project</p>
<p>Maybe also turn it into something useful while I figure out what the blog will be about... A project management software???</p>
<p>Try using MySQL in the next iteration?</p>
